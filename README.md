# Context-aware Mouse Behaviour Recognition using Hidden Markov Models
### Introduction

Automated recognition of mouse behaviours is crucial in studying psychiatric and neurologic diseases. To achieve
this objective, it is very important to analyse temporal dynamics of mouse behaviours. Here, we release the code of our paper for mouse behavior recognition in a video.
