% Used to shrink a multidimensional array I by integer amount.
%
% ratios specifies the block dimensions.  For example, ratios=[2 3 4] shrinks a 3
% dimensional array I by a factor of 2 along the first dimension, 3 along the secong and 4
% along the third.  ratios must be strictly positive integers.  A value of 1 means no
% shrinking is done along a given dimension. 
%
% Can handle very large arrays in a memory efficient manner.
% All the work is done by localsum_block.
%
% INPUTS
%   I       - k dimensional input array 
%   ratios  - k element vector of shrinking factors
%
% OUTPUTS
%   I   - shrunk version of input

% SLOW / BROKEN - gaussian version of above    
% gauss controls whether the smoothing is done by a gaussian or
% averaging window.  Using an averaging window (gauss==0) is equivalent to
% dividing the array into non-overlapping cube shaped blocks.  Using a
% gaussian is equivalent to using slightly overlapping elliptical blocks.
% In this case the standard deviations of the gaussians are automatically
% determined from ratios.  NOTE: sigmas are set to ratios/2/1.6.  Is this ideal?
%
% The array is first smoothed, then it is subsampled.  An equivalent way to
% think of this operation is that the array is divided into a series of
% blocks (with minimal or no overlap), and then each block is replaced by
% its average.   
%        
%     if(gauss)
%         % get smoothed version of I
%         sigmas = ratios/2 / 1.6; sigmas(ratios==1)=0; %is this an ideal value of sigmas?
%         I = gauss_smooth( I, sigmas, 'full' );
%         I = arraycrop2dims( I, siz-ratios+1 );

%         % now subsample smoothed I
%         sizsum = size(I);
